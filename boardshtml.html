        A technology forensics specialist is an information technology professional who supports the military, corporate, law
enforcement and legal communities in the investigation and analysis of digital data. Students in the Technology Forensics
degree will learn methods to obtain and document digital information, determine how information was compromised, trace
attribution of malicious code and reverse engineer data to develop mitigations and countermeasures. This degree will prepare
students to anticipate new and emerging technologies so they can be successful within the rapidly evolving digital forensics
environment and the increasingly complete threat landscape. Graduates from the Technology Forensics major will have both
the technical skills for recovering evidence and the presentation skills to provide both detailed technical and summary data to
interested parties. Above all, this degree will focus on learning the highly technical and cutting-edge technologies affecting IT
systems today and tomorrow. The Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code for Technology Forensics is 11.1003.
